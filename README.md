# Let's talk about congestion pricing

This repository hosts ongoing academic work led by staff and students investigating the **design, data, and potential impacts of Auckland’s upcoming congestion pricing (CP) scheme**. The project aims to connect **geospatial analytics, traffic datasets, and behavioural modelling** to understand the spatial and social implications of road pricing in the Auckland region.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Congestion pricing is being considered as part of Auckland’s broader transport demand management strategy. Our work focuses on:

- Estimating traffic volume and congestion using open-source data  
- Analysing commuter flow patterns across different transport modes  
- Reviewing global experiences (London, Stockholm, Singapore, etc.) to inform Auckland’s design  
- Assessing the potential spatial spillover and equity impacts

## 🗂️ Data Sources

### **1. TomTom Traffic Statistics**
We use **TomTom Traffic Stats – Area Analysis** to estimate congestion levels and travel speeds across Auckland’s urban road network.

- Aggregated at the **road segment level**
- Includes **travel time, delay index, and speed variation** by hour and day  
- Time range: 15–21 August 2024  
- Processed and analysed using R and Python (see `scripts/traffic_analysis/`)

### **2. Commuter Origin–Destination (OD) Data**
**Source:** Stats NZ [Census 2023 Commuter Dataset](https://datafinder.stats.govt.nz/data/category/census/2023/commuter-dataset/)  

- Provides **home-to-work OD flows** across SA2/SA3 regions  
- Used to map potential CP zone influence areas and assess alternative route choices  
- Integrated using `sf` and `sfnetworks` packages  


### **3. agent-based modelling**

- In collaboration with the University of Glasgow (TBC)
